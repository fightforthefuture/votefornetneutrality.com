    <h2>HOW WE CHOSE KEY DISTRICTS</h2>

    <p>Every election is important. And we want every candidate for office to publicly support strong net neutrality protections. But there are certain races where we have the greatest chance to make net neutrality a top issue and get more members of Congress on our side. Here’s the criteria we’re using:</p>

    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>The incumbent member of Congress opposes net neutrality or has no position on net neutrality</li>
      <li>The incumbent member of Congress is in a ‘Toss Up’ race according to <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings" target="_blank">The Cook Political Report</a></li>
      <li>The incumbent member of Congress is facing a challenger with a commitment to support net neutrality</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It’s important to note that some politicians pay lip service to net neutrality.  But every sitting member of Congress has the opportunity to support the CRA to restore net neutrality.  If they don’t then they’re not serious about defending the free and open Internet. We’re focusing on these key races to make sure those lawmakers know that if they continue ignoring their constituents, it could cost them at the polls.</p>
